# Quickstart

### Dev Proxy

Turn your ChatGPT account into an OpenAI-Compatible API. [Learn more](#dev-proxy)

```txt
$ npx openai-oauth@latest

OpenAI-compatible endpoint ready at http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1
Use this as your OpenAI base URL. No API key is required.
Available Models: gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-image-2, ...
```

### TypeScript SDK

Access your ChatGPT account directly from TypeScript on your machine

```bash
npm i @openai-oauth/local @openai-oauth/ai-sdk ai
```

If you are not signed in to Codex locally, first run `npx openai-oauth login`.

```ts
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(openaiCredentials());

const result = await generateText({
	model: openai("gpt-5.4-mini"),
	prompt: "Hello!",
});
```

Works with any OpenAI-compatible client. [Learn more](#typescript-sdk)

### React Component

Let your users sign in with their ChatGPT accounts.

<picture>
  <source srcset="/assets/sign-in-with-chatgpt-button.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="/assets/sign-in-with-chatgpt-button.png" alt="Sign in with ChatGPT" width="320">
</picture>

```bash
npm i @openai-oauth/react @openai-oauth/ai-sdk ai @ai-sdk/react
```

Quickstart for Next.js:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { openaiAuthHeaders, SignInWithChatGPT } from "@openai-oauth/react";
import { useCompletion } from "@ai-sdk/react";

export default function Page() {
	const { complete, completion, isLoading } = useCompletion({
		api: "/api/chat",
		streamProtocol: "text",
	});

	return (
		<>
			<SignInWithChatGPT />
			<button
				disabled={isLoading}
				onClick={async () => {
					await complete("Hello!", {
						headers: await openaiAuthHeaders(),
					});
				}}
			>
				Ask
			</button>
			<p>{completion}</p>
		</>
	);
}
```

```ts
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/react/server";
import { streamText } from "ai";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
	const { prompt } = await request.json();
	const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(openaiCredentials(request));

	const result = streamText({
		model: openai("gpt-5.4-mini"),
		prompt,
	});

	return result.toTextStreamResponse();
}
```

First-time users will be prompted to install Sign in with ChatGPT for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sign-in-with-chatgpt/odbgboachaefbbbdiffcefhpkekhfcna) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sign-in-with-chatgpt/) for secure authentication.

Works with any web framework and OpenAI-compatible client. [Learn more](#react-component)

# Docs

For more information on each of the packages, refer to package-specific `README.md`.

## What is Supported

- Working Endpoints:
  - `/v1/responses`
  - `/v1/chat/completions`
  - `/v1/models` (account-aware by default, or overridden with `--models`)
- Streaming Responses
- Toolcalls
- Reasoning Traces

See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for more information.

## `openai-oauth` CLI

```bash
npx openai-oauth
```

This starts an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (by default at `localhost:10531`) that is connected to your ChatGPT account.

Press `d` to keep it running in the background or `q` to quit. You can also start it in the background directly:

```bash
npx openai-oauth --detach
npx openai-oauth status
```

Follow its logs or stop it from any terminal:

```bash
npx openai-oauth logs --follow
npx openai-oauth stop
```

If you are not signed in, it will ask you to sign in locally. Your credentials will be stored in `~/.codex` (the same place `codex` CLI uses).

You can always directly sign in (without starting the server):

```bash
npx openai-oauth login
```

Login listens on loopback and uses `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`, the local callback URL accepted by OpenAI OAuth.

The CLI also supports a few configuration options that generally do not need to be edited.

## SDK Overview

The `openai-oauth` SDK allows you to integrate ChatGPT login into your local apps and also enable **Sign in with ChatGPT** for your users.

<picture>
  <source srcset="/assets/package-structure.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="/assets/package-structure.png" alt="OpenAI OAuth package structure">
</picture>

The SDK is primarily built around two concepts:

- **Credential Sources**: A way to get a ChatGPT OAuth session
  - Such as local authentication, or when a user auths with **Sign in with ChatGPT**
- **Client Adapters**: Allows you to actually use the Credential Source
  - Such as with Vercel's AI SDK or with the OpenAI client

In general, the SDK will follow this pattern:

```ts
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { generateText } from "ai";

// Get credentials from local
const credentials = openaiCredentials();

// Use those credentials to create an AI SDK object
const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(credentials);

// Use AI SDK to run the request
const result = await generateText({
	model: openai("gpt-5.4-mini"),
	prompt: "Hello!",
});
```

## Credential Sources

These allow you to get the OAuth credentials from OpenAI.

### `@openai-oauth/local`

```bash
npm i @openai-oauth/local
```

Use local Codex credentials which live on your machine (normally at `~/.codex`).

```ts
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";

const credentials = openaiCredentials();
```

This should work out-of-the-box if you're already logged in with Codex, but to log in again, you can run `npx openai-oauth login`.

You can also point to a specific auth file:

```ts
const credentials = openaiCredentials({
	authFilePath: "/path/to/auth.json",
});
```

### `@openai-oauth/react`

```bash
npm i @openai-oauth/react
```

Use request-bound credentials from the user's browser, with **Sign in with ChatGPT**.

```ts
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/web/server";

const credentials = openaiCredentials(request);
```

`openaiAuthHeaders()` returns a plain header object, so it works with both `fetch` and AI SDK hooks like `useCompletion`.

In order to actually establish the credentials in the user's browser, you can use `openai-oauth`'s built-in **Sign in with ChatGPT** SDK, [documented below](#sign-in-with-chatgpt-setup).

For framework neutral usage, see documentation for `@openai-oauth/web` in `packages/web`.

### How are web credentials stored?

Your OpenAI credentials are by default stored on your device in IndexedDB and encrypted at rest with WebCrypto.
Your app server receives request-bound credentials only when the browser sends them with `openaiAuthHeaders()`, which returns a plain header object.

`openai-oauth` lets you bring your own credential storage solution if this is not good enough. See documentation for `@openai-oauth/web` in `packages/web` for more information.

## Client Adapters

These adapters let you use your `openai-oauth` credentials in any client.

### `@openai-oauth/ai-sdk`

```bash
npm i openai @openai-oauth/ai-sdk
```

Connect `openai-oauth` to Vercel AI SDK with this provider.

```ts
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(openaiCredentials());

const result = await generateText({
	model: openai("gpt-5.5"),
	prompt: "Reply with exactly: hello",
});
```

[Learn more](https://ai-sdk.dev/) about how to use Vercel AI SDK.
See supported features [above](#what-is-supported).

<details>
<summary>Migrating from <code>openai-oauth-provider</code></summary>

Vercel AI SDK integration is now independent of your credential source. `openai-oauth-provider` will soon be deprecated, and the preferred route for using local credentials with the Vercel AI SDK is shown in the example above.

You now import and provide an extra `openaiCredentials`, either from `@openai-oauth/local` for local credentials as before or from another credential source.

</details>

### `@openai-oauth/openai-client`

```bash
npm i openai @openai-oauth/openai-client
```

OpenAI JavaScript SDK options adapter.

```ts
import { createOpenAIOptions } from "@openai-oauth/openai-client";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI(createOpenAIOptions(openaiCredentials()));
```

### Custom Adapters

`openai-oauth` also works with any OpenAI-compatible client as long as it takes a custom `baseURL` and `fetch`.

```ts
import { createOpenAIOAuthTransport } from "@openai-oauth/core";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";

const credentials = openaiCredentials();

const transport = createOpenAIOAuthTransport({
	auth: () => credentials.getSession(),
});

const baseURL = transport.baseURL;
const fetch = transport.fetch;
```

For example, here's how you would implement the OpenAI JavaScript SDK manually:

```ts
const client = new OpenAI({
	apiKey: "openai-oauth",
	baseURL: transport.baseURL,
	fetch: transport.fetch,
});
```

## Image Generation

Generate and edit images with GPT Image 2 using the same ChatGPT credentials and client adapters.

The dev proxy exposes the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` endpoints:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-2","prompt":"A tiny house in a forest"}'
```

With Vercel AI SDK:

```ts
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import { generateImage } from "ai";

const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(openaiCredentials());

const result = await generateImage({
	model: openai.image("gpt-image-2"),
	prompt: "A tiny house in a forest",
});
```

With the OpenAI JavaScript SDK:

```ts
import { createOpenAIOptions } from "@openai-oauth/openai-client";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/local";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI(createOpenAIOptions(openaiCredentials()));

const result = await client.images.generate({
	model: "gpt-image-2",
	prompt: "A tiny house in a forest",
});
```

Image editing uses the same clients through `generateImage()` or `client.images.edit()`. Image streaming, masks, custom output formats, and variations are not currently supported.

## Sign in with ChatGPT Setup

Use `SignInWithChatGPT` when users should sign in with their own ChatGPT account.

```bash
npm i @openai-oauth/react
```

It is currently only available for React.

```tsx
"use client";

import { SignInWithChatGPT } from "@openai-oauth/react";

export default function Page() {
	return <SignInWithChatGPT />;
}
```

The button handles the full browser sign-in flow. After sign-in, it becomes a disconnect button.

The prebuilt button includes a small "Powered by OpenAI OAuth" link by default to support this project. Pass `hideAttribution` to remove the attribution link.

Hosted web apps need the open-source Sign in with ChatGPT extension for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sign-in-with-chatgpt/odbgboachaefbbbdiffcefhpkekhfcna) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sign-in-with-chatgpt/) to complete the OAuth handoff securely. The prebuilt component detects the current browser and shows the correct install screen when needed.

Model requests cannot be made directly from a browser due to CORS (This also applies for Desktop apps inside a WebView or browser renderer such as Electron or Tauri).

For hosted web apps, one way to do this is to send the browser session to your own app route:

```ts
import { openaiAuthHeaders } from "@openai-oauth/react";

await fetch("/api/chat", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: await openaiAuthHeaders(),
	body: "Hello!",
});
```

`openaiAuthHeaders()` returns a plain object, so it can be passed directly to `fetch`, AI SDK hooks, and other code that spreads header objects.

Then read request-bound credentials on the server:

```ts
import { createOpenAIOAuth } from "@openai-oauth/ai-sdk";
import { openaiCredentials } from "@openai-oauth/react/server";
import { generateText } from "ai";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
	const openai = createOpenAIOAuth(openaiCredentials(request));

	const result = await generateText({
		model: openai("gpt-5.4-mini"),
		prompt: await request.text(),
	});

	return new Response(result.text);
}
```

Useful props:

```tsx
<SignInWithChatGPT
	onSuccess={(session) => console.log(session.accountId)}
	onError={(error) => console.error(error.message)}
	onStateChange={(state) => console.log(state.status)}
	hideAttribution
/>
```

Additionally, you can create a custom sign-in system with the hook. Custom interfaces are responsible for presenting the extension installation link when needed.

```tsx
import { useSignInWithChatGPT } from "@openai-oauth/react";

function CustomLogin() {
	const login = useSignInWithChatGPT();

	if (login.status === "signed-in") {
		return <button onClick={login.logout}>Disconnect</button>;
	}

	if (login.status === "needs-extension") {
		return (
			<div>
				<a href={login.installUrl} rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
					Install Sign in with ChatGPT
				</a>
				<button onClick={login.login}>Try again</button>
				<button onClick={login.reset}>Cancel</button>
			</div>
		);
	}

	return (
		<button onClick={login.login}>Sign in with ChatGPT</button>
	);
}
```

## Known Limitations

What is intentionally not there yet:

- Only models supported by Codex are available. This list updates over time and depends on your ChatGPT plan.
- There is no stateful replay support on the CLI `/v1/responses` endpoint. The proxy is stateless and expects callers to send the full conversation history.
- Hosted browser sign-in currently supports Chrome and Firefox. Safari is not yet supported.

## How it Works

OpenAI's Codex CLI uses authenticated endpoints at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex` to run models with your ChatGPT account.

By using the same Oauth tokens as Codex, we can effectively use OpenAI's API through Oauth instead of buying API credits.
